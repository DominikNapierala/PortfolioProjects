# EditViz CSV
## Modules used
Tkinter, Pandas, CSV, Seaborn (to be implemented)
### Description:
I am currently working on this project. The idea is that the user will be able to load a csv file and view it as a table. The user will be able to remove rows, remove columns, replace values, export modified table and also visualize the data (not yet implemented).
This is the current state of the app:

Now I am working on implementing the functionality to visualize the data. After it's done, I will work on the appearance of the app.
